### Project Description


### The Problem statement
We’re college students, and somehow the money disappears before the month ends. 💸 We don’t really know where it all went—food, outings, shopping… it just adds up. By the time we check, we’re already broke. The finance apps out there feel like boring spreadsheets and don’t really relate to how we spend.

### The Solution
We wanted something that actually speaks our language. BrokeNoMoreBabe is a fun, student-friendly budgeting app that:
Lets us set a monthly budget
Tracks spending category-wise (Dress, Food, Travel, Academic…)
Shows a visual dashboard so we can see where the money’s going
Features a Savage Baddie Advisor that pops up and roasts us when we overspend
It turns boring budgeting into something interactive, relatable, and even entertaining like having a brutally honest friend keeping us in check.
